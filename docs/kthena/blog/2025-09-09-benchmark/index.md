# Kthena Router ScorePlugin Architecture and Benchmark Analysis

## Abstract

This paper analyzes the system design and implementation of the **ScorePlugin** module in **Kthena Router**, which leverages a configurable, pluggable architecture to enable multi-dimensional scoring and intelligent routing of inference requests. We provide a detailed examination of the six currently implemented **ScorePlugins**, and construct a standardized benchmarking environment based on the **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B** model to evaluate the performance of different scheduling strategies under both long and short system prompt scenarios.

Experimental results demonstrate that in **long system prompt scenarios**, the **KVCacheAware Plugin + Least Request Plugin** combination achieves **2.73× higher throughput** and reduces **TTFT latency by 73.5%**, significantly optimizing overall inference service performance and validating the core value of cache-aware scheduling for large-scale model inference.

## 1. Introduction

In **LLM inference services**, intelligent request scheduling strategies have a decisive impact on overall system performance. Kthena Router adopts a **score-based scheduling framework** that enables multi-strategy load balancing through an **extensible plugin system**. This paper systematically analyzes the architectural design, core algorithms, and performance characteristics of this scheduling system.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Interface Design

The scheduling system in Kthena Router is built around a unified **ScorePlugin** interface:

```go
type ScorePlugin interface {
    Name() string
    Score(ctx *Context, pods []*datastore.PodInfo) map[*datastore.PodInfo]int
}
```

Each plugin generates a **normalized score in the range [0, 100]** for candidate Pods, where higher scores indicate better suitability for the incoming inference request.

### 2.2 Scheduling Execution Pipeline

The scheduler uses a **multi-stage pipeline architecture** consisting of the following steps:

1. **Filtering Phase** - Executes resource constraint checks and availability validation through Filter Plugins
2. **Scoring Phase** - Multiple Score Plugins calculate Pod suitability scores in parallel
3. **Weighted Aggregation** - Combines multi-plugin results according to configurable weights
4. **Selection Decision** - Selects the top-N Pods based on the final aggregated score

## 3. ScorePlugin Implementations

### 3.1 GPU Cache Usage Plugin

A resource-aware scheduling strategy based on **GPU cache utilization**.

**Algorithm Principles:**

- Monitors the **GPU cache usage rate** (`GPUCacheUsage`) of each Pod in real time
- Scoring function:
  ```
  Score = (1.0 - GPUCacheUsage) × 100
  ```
- Prioritizes Pods with **lower GPU cache utilization**, reducing the risk of memory overflow

**Use Case:** Environments with limited GPU memory availability.

### 3.2 Least Request Plugin

A load-balancing strategy based on **active request queue length**.

**Algorithm Principles:**

- **Metrics:**
  - Running request count: `RequestRunningNum`
  - Waiting queue length: `RequestWaitingNum`
- **Base load calculation:**
  ```
  base = RequestRunningNum + 100 × RequestWaitingNum
  ```
- **Normalized score:**
  ```
  score = ((maxScore - baseScores[info]) / maxScore) × 100
  ```

**Key Design Details:**

- Waiting queue weight factor set to **100**, strongly penalizing Pods with backlog accumulation
- Enables **dynamic load-aware balancing**

### 3.3 Least Latency Plugin

A performance-oriented scheduling strategy driven by **inference latency metrics**.

**Algorithm Principles:**

- **Metrics Monitored:**
  - **TTFT** (*Time To First Token*)
  - **TPOT** (*Time Per Output Token*)
- **Normalization:**
  ```
  ScoreTTFT = (MaxTTFT - CurrentTTFT) / (MaxTTFT - MinTTFT) × 100
  ScoreTPOT = (MaxTPOT - CurrentTPOT) / (MaxTPOT - MinTPOT) × 100
  ```
- **Final weighted score:**
  ```
  Score = α × ScoreTTFT + (1 - α) × ScoreTPOT
  ```

**Configuration:**

```yaml
TTFTTPOTWeightFactor: 0.5  # TTFT weight α
```

### 3.4 KVCacheAware Plugin

An advanced **cache-aware scheduling strategy** leveraging **KV cache hit rates**.

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Token-level semantic matching** with model-specific tokenizers
- **Distributed cache coordination** via Redis for cross-Pod state synchronization
- **Optimized contiguous block matching algorithm** to maximize cache hits

**Algorithm Workflow:**

1. **Tokenization Stage**
   ```
   Input → Model-specific Tokenizer → Token Sequence [t₁, t₂, ..., tₙ]
   ```

2. **Block Segmentation**
   ```
   Token Sequence → Fixed-size Blocks [B₁, B₂, ..., Bₘ]
   Block size: 128 tokens (configurable)
   ```

3. **Hash Generation**
   ```
   For each Bᵢ: Hash(Bᵢ) = SHA256(Bᵢ) → hᵢ
   ```

4. **Distributed Cache Query**
   ```
   Redis pipeline query:
   For each hᵢ → {Pod₁: timestamp₁, Pod₂: timestamp₂, ...}
   ```

5. **Contiguous Matching Score**
   ```
   Score = (Number of contiguous matching blocks / Total blocks) × 100
   ```

**Configuration Example:**

```yaml
blockSizeToHash: 128      # Token block size
maxBlocksToMatch: 128     # Maximum blocks to process
```

**Redis Key Structure:**

```
Key Pattern: "matrix:kv:block:{model}@{hash}"
Value Structure:
{
  "pod-name-1.namespace": "1703123456",
  "pod-name-2.namespace": "1703123789"
}
```

### 3.5 Prefix Cache Plugin

A **prefix-based cache-aware scheduling strategy**.

**Architecture Design:**

- **Three-level mapping**: `Model → Hash → Pod`
- **LRU-based cache eviction** for efficient memory management
- **Top-K prefix matching strategy** to return the top Pods with the longest prefix matches

**Key Features:**

- Byte-level prefix matching algorithm
- Optimized in-memory LRU implementation
- Configurable cache capacity and candidate size

### 3.6 Random Plugin

A **lightweight random load-balancing strategy**.

**Implementation:**

- Generates uniformly distributed random scores:
  ```
  Score ~ Uniform(0, 100)
  ```
- Thread-safe independent random number generator
- Stateless design ensures long-term balancing behavior

**Use Cases:**

- Mixed workloads without clear patterns
- Lightweight deployments avoiding complex scheduling overhead
- Establishing baseline performance comparisons

- **Peak throughput** of 32.22 req/s with **KVCacheAware + Least Request**, a **173% improvement** over the Random baseline
- **TTFT reduction** from 2.15s to 0.57s (**73.5% decrease**)
- **End-to-end latency** reduced from 25.23s to 9.22s (**63.5% improvement**)

### 5.2 Scenario Adaptability

**Long Prefix Scenario (4096 tokens):**
