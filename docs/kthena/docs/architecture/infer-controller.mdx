# Infer Controller

Infer Controller is the controller for the inference workload `ModelInfer` in Kthena, which is used to reconcile `ModelInfer` resources and manage the lifecycle of inference pods.

## ModelInfer Overview

`ModelInfer` represents the optimal deployment paradigm for distributed inference scenarios involving large models, offering flexible and user-friendly workload configurations with
Prefilling Decoding Disaggregation and parallel inference services like Pipeline Parallelism (PP) and Tensor Parallelism (TP).

## ModelInfer Architecture

<LightboxImage src="/img/modelinfer.svg" alt="modelinfer.svg"/>

The Custom Resource Definition (CRD) of `ModelInfer` is primarily divided into three layers, namely:

1. ModelInfer

`ModelInfer` is a novel type of workload designed to define specific inference services. It manages a set of `InferGroup` inference instances with consistent configurations

- Supports topology aware and gang scheduling: It enables the simultaneous scheduling of inference pods within an `InferGroup` to the same **HyperNode**, and allows for the configuration of gang scheduling parameters.
  Scheduling is only permitted when the HyperNode meets the **minimum number** of pods required for the inference tasks.
- Supports scaling and rolling upgrades: It provides scaling capabilities at both the `InferGroup` level and `Role` level, along with fault recovery capabilities. The current controller supports sequential rolling upgrades for InferGroups.

2. InferGroup

`InferGroup` is a group of inference instances, representing the smallest unit capable of independently completing a single inference service.

- Supports defining multiple inference roles: Based on `Role` to represent inference roles such as **Prefill** and **Decode**, enabling the management of complex inference scenarios like xPyD configurations.
- Supports graceful reconstruction: During the execution of inference tasks, if a failure occurs, the system allows a configurable grace period for pods recovery before triggering rebuilding, minimizing service interruption.

3. Role

`Role` represents the smallest functional unit, which can correspond to specific instance types such as Prefill, Decode, Aggregated.

- Supports double-Pod templates: Within a single `Role` instance, two distinct Pod templates can be defined as `Entry` Pod and `Worker` Pod. 
`Entry` Pod serves as the entry point to receive inference requests and distribute tasks, while the `Worker` Pod is responsible for executing the actual inference computations.
- Supports network topology aware scheduling: Enables the co-location scheduling of `Entry` Pods and `Worker` Pods within the same `Role` to the same **HyperNode**.
