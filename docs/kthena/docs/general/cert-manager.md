# Certificate Management

This page describes the certificate management options available in Kthena for SSL/TLS certificates.

## Overview

Kthena provides multiple options for managing TLS certificates for webhook servers and other components:

1. **Auto-Generated Certificates**: Self-signed certificates automatically generated by webhook servers (New!)
2. **cert-manager Integration**: Automated certificate lifecycle management using cert-manager
3. **Manual Certificate Provisioning**: User-provided certificates

The integration covers:
- **Admission Webhooks**: TLS certificates for registry, workload, and networking webhook servers
- **Kthena Router**: TLS certificates for external API access
- **Internal Communication**: Service-to-service encrypted communication

## Option 1: Auto-Generated Certificates (Recommended for Development)

The simplest way to get started is to enable automatic certificate generation. When enabled, webhook servers will generate self-signed certificates on startup if they don't exist.

### Features

- **Zero Configuration**: No external dependencies or manual certificate generation required
- **Multi-Pod Support**: First pod creates the certificate secret; subsequent pods reuse it
- **Automatic Race Condition Handling**: Safe for multiple replicas starting simultaneously
- **10-Year Validity**: Long-lived certificates that don't require frequent rotation

### Configuration

Enable auto-generation in your Helm values:

```yaml
# For kthena-controller-manager webhook
workload:
  controllerManager:
    webhook:
      enabled: true
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: true
        certSecretName: kthena-webhook-certs
        serviceName: kthena-webhook

# For kthena-router webhook
networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    webhook:
      enabled: true
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: true
        secretName: kthena-router-webhook-certs
        serviceName: kthena-router-webhook
```

### How It Works

1. On startup, the webhook server checks if the certificate secret exists
2. If the secret exists, it uses the existing certificates
3. If the secret doesn't exist, it generates:
   - A self-signed CA certificate
   - A server certificate signed by the CA
   - A private key
4. The certificates are stored in a Kubernetes secret with a fixed name
5. If multiple pods start simultaneously, the first one creates the secret; others detect the existing secret and use it

### RBAC Requirements

The service account needs permissions to create and read secrets:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "watch"]
```

## Option 2: CertManager Integration (Recommended for Production)

Kthena supports integration with [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for production-grade certificate management. cert-manager handles certificate lifecycle management including issuance, renewal, and rotation.

### Prerequisites

Before enabling cert-manager integration, ensure that:

1. **cert-manager is installed** in your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the [official installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
2. **Sufficient RBAC permissions** are available for cert-manager to create and manage certificates in your namespace.

### Configuration

cert-manager integration is controlled through the `global.certManager.enabled` flag in your Helm values:

```yaml
global:
  certManager:
    # Enable cert-manager integration for all components
    enabled: true

# Disable auto-generated certificates when using cert-manager
workload:
  controllerManager:
    webhook:
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: false

networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    webhook:
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: false
```

When enabled, Kthena will automatically create:
- Self-signed `Issuer` resources for each component
- `Certificate` resources with appropriate DNS names
- TLS secrets for storing certificates and private keys

### Component-Specific Configuration

#### Kthena Router TLS

For external API access, configure the kthena router TLS settings:

```yaml
networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    enabled: true
    tls:
      enabled: true
      # The DNS name for your external domain
      dnsName: "your-domain.com"
      # Secret name to store the TLS certificate
      secretName: "kthena-router-tls"
```

#### Webhook Certificates

Webhook certificates are automatically configured when cert-manager is enabled. Each subchart (registry, workload, networking) creates its own webhook certificates with internal DNS names:

- `<subchart-name>-webhook.<namespace>.svc`
- `<subchart-name>-webhook.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

## Option 3: Manual Certificate Management

If cert-manager is not available or you prefer manual certificate management, disable cert-manager and provide your own CA bundle:

```yaml
global:
  certManager:
    enabled: false
  webhook:
    # Base64-encoded CA bundle for webhook certificates
    caBundle: "LS0tLS1CRUdJTi..."

# Disable auto-generated certificates when using manual certs
workload:
  controllerManager:
    webhook:
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: false

networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    webhook:
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: false
```

To generate a CA bundle:
```bash
cat /path/to/your/ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n'
```

## Certificate Resources

When cert-manager integration is enabled, the following resources are created:

### Issuers
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-issuer` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<subchart-name>-router-issuer` (for kthena router)

### Certificates
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-cert` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<subchart-name>-router-cert` (for kthena router)

### Secrets
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-certs` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<secretName>` (configurable for kthena router)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### cert-manager Not Found
```
Error: failed to create certificate: cert-manager.io/v1, Kind=Certificate not found
```
**Solution**: Install cert-manager in your cluster before enabling the integration.

#### Certificate Not Ready
```
Certificate is not ready: certificate request has not been approved
```
**Solution**: Check cert-manager logs and ensure the issuer is properly configured:
```bash
kubectl describe certificate <certificate-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager
```

#### Webhook Connection Refused
```
Error: connection refused when calling webhook
```
**Solution**: Verify webhook certificates are properly mounted and the service is accessible:
```bash
kubectl get certificates -n <namespace>
kubectl describe secret <webhook-secret-name> -n <namespace>
```

#### DNS Resolution Issues
```
Error: certificate validation failed for DNS name
```
**Solution**: Ensure DNS names in your configuration are resolvable and match your actual service endpoints.

### Debugging Commands

Check certificate status:
```bash
kubectl get certificates -n <namespace>
kubectl describe certificate <certificate-name> -n <namespace>
```

Verify issuer status:
```bash
kubectl get issuers -n <namespace>
kubectl describe issuer <issuer-name> -n <namespace>
```

Check cert-manager logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager-webhook
```

## Comparison of Certificate Options

| Feature | Auto-Generated | cert-manager | Manual |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Setup Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| External Dependencies | None | cert-manager required | Certificate generation tools |
| Certificate Rotation | Manual (10-year validity) | Automatic | Manual |
| Production Ready | Development/Testing | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-Pod Support | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Custom CA Support | No (self-signed) | Yes | Yes |
| Certificate Monitoring | Basic | Advanced | Manual |

## Choosing the Right Option

- **Development/Testing**: Use auto-generated certificates for simplicity
- **Production with cert-manager**: Use cert-manager integration for automated lifecycle management
- **Production without cert-manager**: Use manual certificate provisioning with your organization's PKI
- **Air-gapped environments**: Use manual certificate provisioning or auto-generated certificates
