# Certificate Management

This page describes the certificate management options available in Kthena for SSL/TLS certificates.

## Overview

Kthena provides **three mutually exclusive options** for managing TLS certificates for webhook servers:

1. **Auto-Generated Certificates** (Default): Self-signed certificates automatically generated by webhook servers
2. **cert-manager Integration**: Automated certificate lifecycle management using cert-manager
3. **Manual Certificate Provisioning**: User-provided certificates

**Important**: Only one option can be active at a time. These options are mutually exclusive.

The integration covers:
- **Admission Webhooks**: TLS certificates for registry, workload, and networking webhook servers
- **Kthena Router**: TLS certificates for external API access
- **Internal Communication**: Service-to-service encrypted communication

## Option 1: Auto-Generated Certificates (Default)

**Status**: Enabled by default

The simplest way to get started. When enabled, webhook servers automatically generate self-signed certificates on startup if they don't exist.

### Features

- **Zero Configuration**: No external dependencies or manual certificate generation required
- **Multi-Pod Support**: First pod creates the certificate secret; subsequent pods reuse it
- **Automatic Race Condition Handling**: Safe for multiple replicas starting simultaneously
- **10-Year Validity**: Long-lived certificates that don't require frequent rotation

### Configuration

Auto-generated certificates are **enabled by default**. To use this option, ensure other options are disabled:

```yaml
global:
  certManager:
    # Disable cert-manager
    enabled: false

# For kthena-controller-manager webhook (enabled by default)
workload:
  controllerManager:
    webhook:
      enabled: true
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: true  # Default: true
        certSecretName: kthena-controller-manager-webhook-certs
        serviceName: kthena-controller-manager-webhook

# For kthena-router webhook (enabled by default)
networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    webhook:
      enabled: true
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: true  # Default: true
        secretName: kthena-router-webhook-certs
        serviceName: kthena-router-webhook
```

### How It Works

1. On startup, the webhook server checks if the certificate secret exists
2. If the secret exists, it uses the existing certificates
3. If the secret doesn't exist, it generates:
   - A self-signed CA certificate
   - A server certificate signed by the CA
   - A private key
4. The certificates are stored in a Kubernetes secret with a fixed name
5. If multiple pods start simultaneously, the first one creates the secret; others detect the existing secret and use it

### RBAC Requirements

The service account needs permissions to create and read secrets:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "watch"]
```

## Option 2: CertManager Integration (For Production)

Kthena supports integration with [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for production-grade certificate management. cert-manager handles certificate lifecycle management including issuance, renewal, and rotation.

**To use this option**: Enable cert-manager and disable auto-generated certificates.

### Prerequisites

Before enabling cert-manager integration, ensure that:

1. **cert-manager is installed** in your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the [official installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
2. **Sufficient RBAC permissions** are available for cert-manager to create and manage certificates in your namespace.

### Configuration

cert-manager integration is controlled through the `global.certManager.enabled` flag. **Important**: Disable auto-generated certificates when using cert-manager:

```yaml
global:
  certManager:
    # Enable cert-manager integration for all components
    enabled: true

# Disable auto-generated certificates when using cert-manager
workload:
  controllerManager:
    webhook:
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: false

networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    webhook:
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: false
```

When enabled, Kthena will automatically create:
- Self-signed `Issuer` resources for each component
- `Certificate` resources with appropriate DNS names
- TLS secrets for storing certificates and private keys

### Component-Specific Configuration

#### Kthena Router TLS

For external API access, configure the kthena router TLS settings:

```yaml
networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    enabled: true
    tls:
      enabled: true
      # The DNS name for your external domain
      dnsName: "your-domain.com"
      # Secret name to store the TLS certificate
      secretName: "kthena-router-tls"
```

#### Webhook Certificates

Webhook certificates are automatically configured when cert-manager is enabled. Each subchart (registry, workload, networking) creates its own webhook certificates with internal DNS names:

- `<subchart-name>-webhook.<namespace>.svc`
- `<subchart-name>-webhook.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

## Option 3: Manual Certificate Management

If you prefer to manage certificates manually (e.g., using your organization's PKI), disable both cert-manager and auto-generated certificates, then provide your own CA bundle.

**To use this option**: Disable both cert-manager and auto-generated certificates, then provide caBundle.

If cert-manager is not available or you prefer manual certificate management, disable cert-manager and provide your own CA bundle:

```yaml
global:
  certManager:
    enabled: false
  webhook:
    # Base64-encoded CA bundle for webhook certificates
    caBundle: "LS0tLS1CRUdJTi..."

# Disable auto-generated certificates when using manual certs
workload:
  controllerManager:
    webhook:
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: false

networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    webhook:
      tls:
        autoGenerateCert: false
```

To generate a CA bundle:
```bash
cat /path/to/your/ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n'
```

## Certificate Resources

When cert-manager integration is enabled, the following resources are created:

### Issuers
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-issuer` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<subchart-name>-router-issuer` (for kthena router)

### Certificates
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-cert` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<subchart-name>-router-cert` (for kthena router)

### Secrets
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-certs` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<secretName>` (configurable for kthena router)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### cert-manager Not Found
```
Error: failed to create certificate: cert-manager.io/v1, Kind=Certificate not found
```
**Solution**: Install cert-manager in your cluster before enabling the integration.

#### Certificate Not Ready
```
Certificate is not ready: certificate request has not been approved
```
**Solution**: Check cert-manager logs and ensure the issuer is properly configured:
```bash
kubectl describe certificate <certificate-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager
```

#### Webhook Connection Refused
```
Error: connection refused when calling webhook
```
**Solution**: Verify webhook certificates are properly mounted and the service is accessible:
```bash
kubectl get certificates -n <namespace>
kubectl describe secret <webhook-secret-name> -n <namespace>
```

#### DNS Resolution Issues
```
Error: certificate validation failed for DNS name
```
**Solution**: Ensure DNS names in your configuration are resolvable and match your actual service endpoints.

### Debugging Commands

Check certificate status:
```bash
kubectl get certificates -n <namespace>
kubectl describe certificate <certificate-name> -n <namespace>
```

Verify issuer status:
```bash
kubectl get issuers -n <namespace>
kubectl describe issuer <issuer-name> -n <namespace>
```

Check cert-manager logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager-webhook
```
