# Architecture Overview

MatrixInfer is a Kubernetes-native AI inference platform built on a **two-plane architecture** designed for scalability, observability, and efficiency. The system separates **control plane operations** and **data plane execution** into distinct architectural planes.

## High-Level Architecture

The platform comprises two primary planes:

- **Control Plane**: MatrixInfer’s model-aware brain. It coordinates models, routes, and servers; validates and stages changes; applies rollout/rollback logic with safety guardrails; and surfaces status/health for clear visibility—focused on model lifecycle and traffic safety rather than cluster mechanics.
- **Data Plane**: MatrixInfer’s runtime path. The Infer Gateway authenticates requests, enforces rate limits and fairness, and uses a pluggable, model-aware Scheduler (e.g., LoRA affinity, KV/GPU cache and latency plugins) to pick the best replica. Role-based **Prefill/Decode** replica groups enable disaggregation and independent scaling for lower latency, higher throughput, and better cost.

## Core Components

### 1. **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**

MatrixInfer extends Kubernetes with custom resources that provide declarative configuration for AI inference workloads:

- **Model** – A high-level, opinionated API that captures model specifications and cascades creation/update/deletion of related resources (ModelRoute, ModelServer, ModelInfer, autoscaling artifacts) to deliver a one-stop model deployment experience.
- **ModelRoute** – Declares routing intent and traffic control: matches by `modelName`, `loraAdapters`, and HTTP attributes (path, headers); supports rule-based routing with weights, canary/A–B strategies, and optional token-based `rateLimit`s.
- **ModelServer** – Defines service exposure and traffic policy for backend inference pods: specifies the model and inference framework/engine, discovers pods via `workloadSelector` (including role-aware groupings such as Prefill/Decode), and applies traffic policies (retries, timeouts, connection settings) for healthy endpoint publication.
- **ModelInfer** – Manages inference workloads as `InferGroup`s with role-based replicas (e.g., Prefill/Decode), supporting configurable entry/worker Pod `template`s, `recoveryPolicy`, topology- and gang-aware scheduling, rolling upgrades, and a dedicated `scheduler`.
- **AutoScalingPolicy** – Specifies autoscaling rules: metric endpoints and triggers (CPU, memory, custom), target thresholds, and scaling behaviors (up/down rates, stabilization and panic windows) for automated replica management.
- **AutoScalingPolicyBinding** – Attaches policies to target workloads (e.g., ModelInfer or Deployments), supporting two modes: **scalingConfiguration** for metric-driven scaling of a single target and **optimizerConfiguration** for cost-aware distribution across heterogeneous instance types and engines (e.g., H100/A100).

Platform operators manage these CRDs declaratively, and Control Plane controllers continuously reconcile them into runtime resources.

### 2. **Control Plane**

The Control Plane ensures that declarative configurations are realized into operational resources through continuous reconciliation of CRDs into runtime resources.

#### **Controllers**

- **Model Controller** – Reconciles `Model` resources into downstream primitives (`ModelRoute`, `ModelServer`, `ModelInfer`, `AutoScalingPolicy`, `AutoScalingPolicyBinding`) and maintains overall model lifecycle and status. It propagates updates and orchestrates cascaded create/update/delete to keep derived resources consistent.
- **ModelRoute Controller** – Projects routing intent into the Infer Gateway by continuously syncing matches, weights, and model/LoRA selectors from `ModelRoute` CRs. It validates and normalizes rule sets to produce the effective routing table used by the gateway.
- **ModelServer Controller** – Tracks backend pods via `workloadSelector`, applies traffic policies (retries, timeouts, connection settings), and publishes healthy endpoints to the gateway. It manages service exposure and connectivity for model-serving backends.
- **ModelInfer Controller** – Manages `ModelInfer` workloads including `InferGroup`s and role-based replicas (e.g., Prefill/Decode). It handles topology- and gang-aware placement, fault recovery, and rolling upgrades, and reconciles entry/worker Pod templates and services for each role.
- **Autoscaler Controller** – Evaluates runtime metrics against `AutoScalingPolicy` targets and computes desired replica counts for bound workloads. It supports homogeneous scaling (stable/panic modes) and heterogeneous optimization via `AutoScalingPolicyBinding`, adjusting replicas and instance mix to meet SLOs and cost goals.

### 3. **Data Plane**

The Data Plane executes inference workloads and handles request processing through the Gateway and Scheduler, using optimized, role-based pod architectures that support both homogeneous and heterogeneous scaling strategies.

#### **Infer Gateway**

The Infer Gateway processes user requests through a comprehensive pipeline that ensures security, fairness, and optimal resource utilization:

##### **Request Pipeline**

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <LightboxImage src="/img/diagrams/architecture/request_pipeline.svg" alt="Request Processing Pipeline" />
</div>

The request pipeline orchestrates the flow of user requests through the following stages:

*   **Authentication & Authorization** – Validates user identity and permissions
*   **Rate Limiting** – Enforces request throughput limits to prevent system overload
*   **Fairness Scheduling** – Implements queuing mechanisms and fair resource allocation
*   **Scheduling** – Selects optimal pods using filter and score plugins for intelligent request routing.
    <details>
        <summary><b>Scheduler (Gateway Component Details)</b></summary>
        <p>The Infer Gateway includes a pluggable Scheduler that plays a crucial role in the "Scheduling" stage of the request pipeline. It employs <b>advanced scheduling plugins</b> to optimize request routing and resource utilization:</p>
        ###### Filter Plugins:
        <ul>
            <li><i>Least Requests</i> – Filters pods based on current request load</li>
            <li><i>LoRA Affinity</i> – Ensures requests requiring specific LoRA adapters are routed to compatible pods</li>
        </ul>
        ###### Score Plugins:
        <ul>
            <li><i>KV Cache Aware</i> – Optimizes routing based on key-value cache availability and utilization</li>
            <li><i>Least Latency</i> – Minimizes Time to First Token (TTFT) and Time Per Output Token (TPOT)</li>
            <li><i>Prefix Cache</i> – Leverages shared prefix caching for improved performance</li>
            <li><i>GPU Cache</i> – Considers GPU memory cache status for optimal routing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It seamlessly integrates with the Infer Gateway’s Load Balancing and Fairness Scheduling components to ensure optimal request distribution.</p>
    </details>

*   **Load Balancing** – Routes requests to optimal backend instances based on health and capacity
*   **Proxy** – Dispatches requests to appropriate data plane inference groups


#### **Inference Pods**

Inference workloads are organized into **Groups** containing **multiple Replicas**. Each replica can assume specialized **roles** to optimize different phases of the inference process:

**Role-Based Architecture:**
- **Prefill Role** – Handles prompt initialization and context processing
- **Decode Role** – Manages incremental token generation and output streaming

**Pod Components:**
Each replica deployment may include the following components:

- **Entry Pod** – Provides ingress endpoints for role-specific requests
- **Worker Pod(s)** – Execute actual model inference computations
- **Downloader** – Universal model/artifact fetcher supporting Hugging Face, S3/OBS, and PVC sources with concurrent downloads, file-based locking, and flexible configuration
- **Runtime Agent** – Sidecar service that proxies and standardizes engine metrics (vLLM/SGLang), exposes LoRA adapter lifecycle APIs (download/load/unload), and provides a model download endpoint
- **LLM Engines** – Integrates with specialized backends (e.g., **vLLM**, **SGLang**)

This architecture enables **Prefill/Decode Disaggregation (PD mode)**, allowing independent scaling of different inference stages for optimal resource utilization and performance.
