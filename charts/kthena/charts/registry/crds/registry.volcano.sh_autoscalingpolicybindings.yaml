                  It dynamically schedules replicas across different Model Infer groups based on overall computing power requirements - referred to as "optimize" behavior in the code.
                  For example:
                  When dealing with two types of Model Infer instances corresponding to heterogeneous hardware resources with different computing capabilities (e.g., H100/A100), the "optimize" behavior aims to:
                  Dynamically adjust the deployment ratio of H100/A100 instances based on real-time computing power demands
                  Use integer programming and similar methods to precisely meet computing requirements
                  Maximize hardware utilization efficiency
